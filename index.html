        <h4>Software Development</h4>
        <p>
          I enjoy web development and technically challenging myself. I have a
          very nontraditional route into software engineering but as a result,
          can ship quality code because I understand the development cycle from
          different perspectives.

        <h5>Running</h5>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy running or being outdoors. It gives me the
          opportunity to clear my head and get some fresh air. Recently I tried
          trail running which was very intensive but an enjoyable challenge!
